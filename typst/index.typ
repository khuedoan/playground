= Introduction

In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence _fluid
dynamics_ in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

+ The climate
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
+ The topography
+ The geology

The equation $Q = rho A v + C$
defines the glacial flow rate.
